                    in a separate document that is part of the policy approved by the commissioner and shall be bolded
                    or otherwise set forth in a conspicuous manner. The person’s signature shall be set forth
                    immediately below the opt-in consent disclosure. If the licensee seeks consent at any time prior to
                    the completion of the application, consent and
                    signature shall be obtained before the application is completed. If the person has not opted in at
                    the time the application is completed, the licensee may receive the opt-in consent at any time
                    thereafter, pursuant to the same opt-in requirements that apply at the time of the application. The
                    licensee shall retain a copy of the signed opt-in consent disclosure with the policy information so
                    that each is retrievable upon request by the department while the policy is in force and for five
                    years thereafter.

                <stat:p>(4) The email address of the person who has consented to electronic transmission shall be set
                    forth on the consent disclosure. In addition, if the person who consented receives an annual
                    statement, the email address of the person who has consented shall be set forth on that record.
                </stat:p>
                <stat:p>(5) The licensee shall annually provide one free printed copy of any record described in this
                    subdivision upon request by the person.
                </stat:p>
                <stat:p>(6) If a provision of this code requires a licensee to transmit a record by first-class mail,
                    regular mail, does not specify a method of delivery, or is a record that is required to be provided
                    pursuant to Article 6.6 (commencing with Section 791), and if the licensee is not otherwise
                    prohibited from transmitting the record electronically under subdivision (b) of Section 1633.8 of
                    the Civil Code, then the record may be transmitted by electronic transmission if the licensee
                    complies with all of the requirements of Sections 1633.15 and 1633.16 of the Civil Code.

                    (7) Notwithstanding subdivision (b) of Section 1633.8 of the Civil Code, if
                    a provision of this code requires a licensee to
                    transmit a record by return receipt, registered mail, certified mail, signed written receipt of
                    delivery, or other method of delivery evidencing actual receipt by the person, and if the licensee
                    is not otherwise prohibited from transmitting the record electronically under Section 1633.3 of the
                    Civil Code and the provisions of this section, then the licensee shall maintain a process or system
                    that demonstrates proof of delivery and actual receipt of the record by the person consistent with
                    this paragraph. The licensee shall document and retain information demonstrating delivery and actual
                    receipt so that it is retrievable, upon request, by the department at least five years after the
                    policy is no longer in force. The record provided by electronic transmission shall be treated as if
                    actually received if the licensee delivers the record to the person in compliance with applicable
                    statutory delivery deadlines. A licensee may demonstrate actual delivery and receipt by any of the
                    following:
                </stat:p>
                <stat:p>(A) The person acknowledges receipt of the electronic transmission of the record by executing an
                    electronic signature.
                </stat:p>
                <stat:p>(B) The record is posted on the licensee’s secure Internet Web site, and there is evidence
                    demonstrating that the person logged onto the licensee’s secure Internet Web site and downloaded,
                    printed, or otherwise acknowledged receipt of the record.
                </stat:p>
                <stat:p>
                    (C) The record is transmitted to the named insured through an application on a personal electronic
                    device that is secured by password, biometric identifier, or other technology, and there is evidence
                    demonstrating that the person logged into the application and
                    viewed or otherwise acknowledged receipt of the record.
                </stat:p>
                <stat:p>(D) If a licensee is unable to demonstrate actual delivery and receipt pursuant to this
                    paragraph, the licensee shall resend the record by regular mail to the person in the manner
                    originally specified by the underlying provision of this code.
                </stat:p>
                <stat:p>(8) Notwithstanding any other law, a notice of lapse, nonrenewal, cancellation, or termination
                    of any product subject to this section may be transmitted electronically if the licensee
                    demonstrates proof of delivery as set forth in paragraph (7) and complies with the other provisions
                    in this section.

                <stat:p>
                    (9) If the record is not delivered directly to the electronic address designated by the person but
                    placed at an electronic address accessible
                    to the person, a licensee shall notify the person in plain, clear, and conspicuous language at the
                    electronic address designated by the person that describes the record, informs that person that it
                    is available at another location, and provides instructions to the person as to how to obtain the
                    record.
                </stat:p>
                <stat:p>(10) (A) Upon a licensee receiving information indicating that the record sent by electronic
                    transmission was not received by the person, the licensee shall, within five business days, comply
                    with either clause (i) or (ii):

                    electronic transmission. If the licensee elects to resend the record by electronic transmission, the
                    licensee shall demonstrate the transmission was
                    received by the person, pursuant to paragraph (6), (7), or (8). If the licensee is unable to confirm
                    or update the person’s email address, the licensee shall resend the record by regular mail to the
                    licensee at the address shown on the policy, or, if the underlying statute requires delivery in a
                    specified manner, send the record in that specified manner.
                </stat:p>
                <stat:p>(ii) Resend the record initially provided by electronic transmission by regular mail to the
                    insured at the address shown on the policy, or, if the underlying statute requires delivery in a
                    specified manner, send the record in that specified manner.

                <stat:p>
                    (B) If the licensee sends the first electronic record within the time period required by law and the
                    licensee complies with both paragraph (5) and subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the
                    record sent pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) of subparagraph (A) shall be treated as if mailed in
                    compliance with the applicable statutory regular mail delivery deadlines.
                </stat:p>
                <stat:p>(11) The licensee shall not charge any person who declines to opt in to receive a record through
                    electronic transmission from receiving a record electronically. The licensee shall not provide a
                    discount or an incentive to any person to opt in to receive electronic records.
                </stat:p>
                <stat:p>(12) The licensee shall verify a person’s email address via paper writing sent by regular mail
                    when more than 12 months have elapsed since the licensee’s last electronic communication.

                    (c) An insurance agent or broker acting under the direction of a party that enters into a

                    person.
                </stat:p>
                <stat:p>(6) If a provision of this code requires a licensee to transmit a record by first-class mail,
                    regular mail, does not specify a method of delivery, or is a record that is required to be provided
                    pursuant to Article 6.6 (commencing with Section 791), and if the licensee is not otherwise
                    prohibited from transmitting the record electronically under subdivision (b) of Section 1633.8 of
                    the Civil Code, then the record may be transmitted by electronic transmission if the licensee
                    complies with all of the requirements of Sections 1633.15 and 1633.16 of the Civil Code.

                    (7) If the record is not delivered directly to the electronic address designated by the person but
                    placed at an
                    electronic address accessible to the person, a licensee shall notify the person in plain, clear, and
                    conspicuous language at the electronic address designated by the person that describes the record,
                    informs that person that it is available at another location, and provides instructions to the
                    person as to how to obtain the record.
                </stat:p>
                <stat:p>(8) (A) Upon a licensee receiving information indicating that the record sent by electronic
                    transmission was not received by the person, the licensee shall, within five business days, comply

                    licensee
                    shall demonstrate the transmission was received by the person, pursuant to paragraph (6). If the
                    licensee is unable to confirm or update the person’s email address, the licensee shall resend the
                    record by regular mail to the licensee at the address shown on the policy, or, if the underlying
                    statute requires delivery in a specified manner, send the record in that specified manner.
                </stat:p>
                <stat:p>(ii) Resend the record initially provided by electronic transmission by regular mail to the
                    insured at the address shown on the policy, or, if the underlying statute requires delivery in a

                <stat:p>
                    (B) If the licensee sends the first electronic record within the time period required by law and the
                    licensee complies with both paragraph (5) and subparagraph (A)
                    of this paragraph, the record sent pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) of subparagraph (A) shall be
                    treated as if mailed in compliance with the applicable statutory regular mail delivery deadlines.
                </stat:p>
                <stat:p>(9) The licensee shall not charge any person who declines to opt in to receive a record through
                    electronic transmission from receiving a record electronically. The licensee shall not provide a

                <stat:p>(e) The department may suspend a licensee from providing records by electronic transmission if
                    there is a pattern or practices that demonstrate the licensee has failed to comply with the

                    taxpayer is unable, for reasonable cause, to make payments pursuant to paragraph (2) or (3). Banking
                    costs charged to the taxpayer and to the state may be charged to the taxpayer.
